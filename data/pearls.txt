Jung noted that there are two types of personality organizations: introversion and extroversion. Introverts focus on their inner world of thoughts, intuitions, emotions, and sensations; extroverts are more oriented toward the outer world, other persons, and material goods. Each person has a mixture of both components. The persona, the mask covering the personality, is the face a person presents to the outside world.

Flooding is similar to graded exposure in that it involves exposing the patient to the feared object in vivo; however, there is no hierarchy. The basis of flooding is the premise that escaping from an anxiety-provoking experience reinforces the anxiety through conditioning. Thus, clinicians can extinguish the anxiety and prevent the conditioned avoidance behavior by not allowing patients to escape the situation. Clinicians encourage patients to confront feared situations directly, without a gradual buildup, as in systematic desensitization or graded exposure.

Neurotransmitters are typically released from axonal terminals into a synapse where they change the postsynaptic membrane potential, either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing the cell. For classical neurotransmitters, this often involves direct modulation of voltage- gated ion channels. In contrast, neuromodulators and neurohormones do not directly affect the firing of the target cell itself but may alter the response of the cell to other neurotransmitters through the modulation of second messenger pathways.
